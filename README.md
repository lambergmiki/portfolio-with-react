# My first React application - a web portfolio

After completing my first year as a web development student, I decided it was time to explore what frameworks are and how they work. Up until now, I’ve built everything from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Since I wanted to create a portfolio website, this felt like the perfect opportunity to try out React. It’s one of the most popular frameworks in the industry, and gaining hands-on experience with more frontend-focused development felt like a smart next step — especially since my most recent project [Matgeneratorn](https://github.com/lambergmiki/matgeneratorn), was more backend-oriented (you can probably tell by the poor frontend I neglected!).
